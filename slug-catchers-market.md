<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slug Catchers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vessel Type Slug Catchers</li><li>Pipe Type Slug Catchers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Slug catchers are critical components in gas processing systems, designed to separate liquid slugs from gas streams. Vessel type slug catchers are large tanks that utilize gravity to allow liquids to settle out of the gas. In contrast, pipe type slug catchers consist of a series of horizontal pipes that provide temporary storage for liquid slugs as they flow through the system. Both types are essential for maintaining pipeline integrity and optimizing gas quality during transportation.</p></p>
